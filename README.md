# fast_api_gemman3
用fast-api构建基于gemman3的快速应用：实现功能：1）RAG文档搜索  2）图片理解 3）视频理解 4）代码审查 5）对话

Using FastAPI to build a rapid application based on Gemini 1.5: Implementation features:  RAG document search  Image understanding  Video understanding  Code review  Conversational interaction


Overall Architecture
Ollama: The engine running in the background on your machine. It serves the LLMs (gemma2) and Multi-modal Models (llava) via a local REST API on port 11434.
FastAPI Application: Our Python backend. It will expose several endpoints (e.g., /chat, /describe-image, /query-document). When a request hits one of these endpoints, our FastAPI code will call the Ollama service, process the request, and return a response.
PyCharm: Our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, running, and debugging the FastAPI application.


This part is crucial and ensures your AI models are ready to be served.
Install Ollama: Go to ollama.com and install the application for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Pull Required Models: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and pull the necessary models. We'll need one for text, one for vision, and one for embeddings (for document search).
Generated bash
# Pull Google's Gemma 2 for text generation
ollama pull gemma2

# Pull LLaVA for image understanding
ollama pull llava

# Pull a good embedding model for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
Use code with caution.
Bash
You can verify the models are installed with ollama list. Make sure the Ollama application is running.


Create Project in PyCharm:
Open PyCharm and select "New Project".
Name it something like fastapi_local_ai.
Ensure a new virtual environment (venv) is created.
Install Python Libraries:
Open the terminal within PyCharm (View -> Tool Windows -> Terminal) and install all the necessary libraries:
Generated bash
# FastAPI and the server to run it
pip install "fastapi[all]"

# The official Ollama Python client (this is better than using 'requests')
pip install ollama

# LangChain for our RAG implementation (document search)
pip install langchain langchain_community langchain-ollama

# For PDF loading and vector storage
pip install pypdf faiss-cpu

# For video processing
pip install opencv-python
Use code with caution.
Bash
Project Structure:
To keep things organized, create the following folders in your project root:
uploads/: To temporarily store uploaded videos.
docs/: To permanently store documents for your RAG system.
vector_store/: To save the generated FAISS vector index.
Your project should look like this:
Generated code
/fastapi_local_ai/
|-- venv/
|-- docs/
|-- uploads/
|-- vector_store/
|-- main.py           # Our main FastAPI application file



Run the FastAPI App:
In your PyCharm terminal, run the following command. uvicorn is the server that will run your FastAPI application.
Generated bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
Use code with caution.
Bash
main: Refers to the main.py file.
app: Refers to the app = FastAPI() object inside main.py.
--reload: This tells the server to automatically restart whenever you save changes to your code.
Use the Interactive API Docs:
FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation for you. This is the best way to test your endpoints.
Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8000/docs
You will see a beautiful interface where you can:
Expand each endpoint (e.g., /describe-image).
Click "Try it out".
Upload files, enter text, and execute the request directly from your browser.
See the exact response from your API.
Testing Workflow:
Test /chat: Enter a prompt and see Gemma2's response.
Test /describe-image: Upload an image and see LLaVA's description.
Test Document RAG:
First, use the /ingest-document endpoint to upload a PDF.
Then, use the /query-document endpoint to ask a question about that PDF.
Test /summarize-video: Upload a short video. Be patient, as this one takes time.
